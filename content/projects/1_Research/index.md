## In situ Flight Data Analysis, Performance, and Planning for STOL Operations
<small>Supervised by Dr. Sudip Bhattrai</small>
- Designed an In Situ Flight Data Analysis (iFDA) toolbox for turboprop aircraft, offering real-time performance calculations and decision-making aids, validated within 3% accuracy against flight manuals and simulations.
- Integrated terrain proximity analysis and dynamic decision support to improve operational safety in complex, geographically constrained short takeoff and landing (STOL) environments.
- Demonstrated the toolbox’s capability in real-time path planning and Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) avoidance for challenging terrains, such as Nepal’s Annapurna region.

## Formulation of Insitu Flight Performance Toolbox for Decision Support System
<small>Undergraduate Thesis
Supervised by Dr. Sudip Bhattrai and Er. Vishal Paudel</small>
- Developed a mathematical model to estimate operational requirements and performance calculations for various
flight phases using MATLAB, particularly tailored to the DHC-6, series 300 aircraft.
- Validated and tested the model by cross-referencing it with performance charts and supplementary data obtained
from Nepal Airlines Corporation.
- Incorporated decision support aids the model for the imposed airport, aircraft, and regulatory limitations.
- Designed an intuitive graphical interface integrating the outputs, decision aids, and flight profiles generated.
