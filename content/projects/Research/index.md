- Designed an In Situ Flight Data Analysis (iFDA) toolbox for turboprop aircraft, offering real-time performance calculations and decision-making aids, validated within 3% accuracy against flight manuals and simulations.
- Integrated terrain proximity analysis and dynamic decision support to improve operational safety in complex, geographically constrained short takeoff and landing (STOL) environments.
- Demonstrated the toolbox’s capability in real-time path planning and Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) avoidance for challenging terrains, such as Nepal’s Annapurna region.

- Developed a mathematical model to estimate operational requirements and performance calculations for various flight phases using MATLAB, particularly tailored to the DHC-6, series 300 aircraft.
- Validated and tested the model by cross-referencing it with performance charts and supplementary data obtained from Nepal Airlines Corporation.
- Incorporated decision support aids the model for the imposed airport, aircraft, and regulatory limitations.
- Designed an intuitive graphical interface integrating the outputs, decision aids, and flight profiles generated.

- Aimed at development of a suitable damping mechanism in landing gear to ensure safety of sensitive payloads during the delivery using UAV,
- Formulated a Simulink-based model to study the effects of spring and damping elements in a simplified oleo strut landing gear system for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).
- Utilized the model developed to choose suitable materials for spring and damper to limit the transmitted shock within 5g’s to ensure the safety of medical packages for a fixed-wing medical delivery drone.
