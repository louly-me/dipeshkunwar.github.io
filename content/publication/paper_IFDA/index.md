abstract: STOL operations require pilots and operations engineers to make routine flight performance calculations. Instead of relying on manual calculation through manufacturer-specific charts, a quick computational tool that can digitally simulate and model this manual process for ease in performance calculation, route planning, in-flight planning, and decision-making, can offer significant advantages. In this study, a toolbox capable of estimating performance data for all phases of flight was developed utilizing analytical and numerical techniques. The toolbox provides decision aids displayed after cross-validation against the constraints imposed by the airport, aircraft configuration, geographical terrain, and regulations. Initially, a generic mathematical model was formulated for turboprop aircraft. The model was then validated for DHC-6 series 300 aircraft against the performance charts in the aircraft flight manual of the DHC-6, series 300 aircraft, for normal and emergency take-off, and landing phases. The deviations in the calculated performance metrics were found to be within 3%. Flight performance parameters for climb, cruise, and descent phases were validated against the data from the flight scenarios simulated in X-Plane and the manufacturerâ€™s supplementary charts. The current toolbox also enables in situ flight data analysis to provide decision support during flight. The toolbox is also capable of providing decision aid in real-time and complex VFR flying scenarios. This study presents the capabilities offered by such a toolbox and discusses the methods by which the complexities of flying in geographically challenged environments can be mitigated by using in situ flight data analysis and mission planning.
