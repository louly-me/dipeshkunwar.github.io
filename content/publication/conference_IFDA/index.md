abstract: STOL operations require pilots and operations engineers to make routine flight performance calculations, which can be inefficient due to the aircraft performance limitation, and geographical and regulatory factors. Instead of relying on manual computations through manufacturer-specific charts, a quick computational tool that can digitally simulate and model this manual process for ease in performance calculation, route planning and in-flight planning, and decision-making, can offer significant advantages. In this study, a toolbox capable of estimating performance data for all phases of flight was developed utilizing analytical and numerical techniques. The toolbox provides decision aids displayed after cross-validation against the constraints imposed by the airport, aircraft configuration, geographical terrain, and regulations. Initially, a generic mathematical model was formulated for turboprop aircraft. The model was then validated for DHC-6 series 300 aircraft against the performance charts included in the aircraft flight manual of the DHC-6, series 300 aircraft, for normal and emergency, take-off, and landing phases. The deviations in the calculated performance metrics were found to be within 3%. Flight performance parameters for climb, cruise, and descent phases were validated against the data from the flight scenarios simulated in XPlane and the manufacturerâ€™s supplementary charts. In order to provide decision support during flight, the current toolbox also enables in-situ flight data analysis. The toolbox is also capable of providing decision aid in real-time and complex VFR flying scenarios. This study presents the capabilities offered by such a toolbox and discusses the methods by which the complexities of flying in geographically challenged environments can be mitigated by using in situ flight data analysis and mission planning.
