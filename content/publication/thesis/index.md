abstract: Performance calculations for aircraft holds a major importance for flight operations and planning, which currently is relied heavily upon manufacturer specific charts. Operations in STOL fields adds further intensity to requirement of the calculations to be precise. The study aimed to enhance the efficiency of flight procedures management, fuel utilization, and flight feasibility assessment for specific circumstances through mathematical models for performance calculation in order to facilitate the flight crew, operators as well as aviation service providers with a means for quick estimation of operational requirements and performance data. A tool was developed using analytical techniques for estimation of operational requirements and performance calculation for different phases of flight which includes decision-making aids that consider the constraints imposed by the airport, aircraft, and regulations to facilitate flight operations. The results generated from the tool were validated against the performance charts included in the AFM of DHC-6, series 300 for takeoff, landing and rejected takeoff condition for which the deviations obtained were within 3%. The remaining phases of flight (i.e., climb, cruise and descent) were validated using simulated flight scenarios as well as manufacturerâ€™s supplementary charts where the discrepancies.
